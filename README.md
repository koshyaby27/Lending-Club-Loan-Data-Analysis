# Prediction of Absenteeism at Work
Absenteeism at work is a problem which is faced by a number of firms around the world. Employee absence at work leads to decreased productivity which in turn affects company finances, morale and even the quality of goods and services. There can be several causes for such absences including illness, injuries, burnout, childcare, harassment and many others. We believe that a machine learning approach can help to predict absenteeism and potentially even help to curb absenteeism.
